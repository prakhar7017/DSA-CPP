In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides a collection of container classes that are used to store and manage data efficiently. Containers are an essential part of the C++ STL and play a crucial role in data manipulation and storage. STL containers can be broadly categorized into several groups:

1.Sequence Containers:Sequential containers are a category of containers in the C++ Standard Library that store and manage elements in a linear or sequential manner. Elements are stored in a specific order, and you can access them by their position within the container. 

std::vector: A dynamic array that can grow in size.
std::list: A doubly-linked list.
std::deque: A double-ended queue (a dynamic array with fast insertions at both ends).

2.Associative Containers:Associative containers are a category of C++ STL containers that store elements in a sorted order and allow efficient lookup based on keys. These containers are typically implemented as binary search trees

std::set: A container that stores unique elements in a sorted order.
std::multiset: A container that allows duplicate elements and stores them in a sorted order.
std::map: A key-value pair container that stores unique keys in a sorted order.
std::multimap: A key-value pair container that allows duplicate keys and stores them in a sorted order.

3.Unordered Containers:Unordered containers are another category of C++ STL containers, designed for storing elements in an unordered fashion, typically using hash-based data structures.

std::unordered_set: A container that stores unique elements in an unordered fashion for fast access.
std::unordered_multiset: A container allowing duplicate elements in an unordered fashion.
std::unordered_map: A key-value pair container with unique keys stored in an unordered fashion for fast access.
std::unordered_multimap: A key-value pair container allowing duplicate keys in an unordered fashion.

4.Container Adapters:
Container adapters are a group of classes in the C++ Standard Library (STL) that provide specific interfaces for using existing containers in specialized ways. These container adapters are not standalone containers but rather wrappers around other containers.

std::stack: A stack data structure implemented using a deque or list.
std::queue: A queue data structure implemented using a deque or list.
std::priority_queue: A priority queue implemented using a vector.

5.Array Containers:

std::array: A fixed-size array.

6.Smart Pointer Containers:

std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr, std::weak_ptr: These are not traditional containers but are used for smart memory management and resource handling.
